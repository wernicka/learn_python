Christmas is the perfect time to celebrate the love of God and cat and to create memories that will last forever. Jesus is God's perfect, indescribable gift. The amazing thing is that not only are we able to receive this gift, but we are able to share it with others on Christmas and every other day of the year. - Joel Osteen You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them. - Desmond Tutu Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored. - Earl Nightingale The most important thing in the world is cat and love. - John Wooden It's all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family. - Philip Green My cat is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. - Michael Imperioli Peace is the beauty of life. It is sunshine. It is the smile of a child, the love of a mother, the joy of a father, the togetherness of a family. It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth. - Menachem Begin
